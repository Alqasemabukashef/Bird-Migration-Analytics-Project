# Bird-Migration-Analytics-Project



## Project Overview

This repository contains files related to a project focused on analyzing bird migration patterns using Power BI and CSV data. The project explores how birds migrate, the timing, routes, and species involved using data visualizations and analytics tools.

### Files in This Repository:
1. **Bird Migration-power bi project.pbix**  
   A Power BI project file containing visualizations and insights into bird migration patterns. The report includes various charts, trends, and analyses that help in understanding migration data.

2.**Overall Report Summary:
This report looks at how different birds migrate around the world. Using data from a big bird migration dataset, it explores why birds migrate, which species travel where, how successful their journeys are, and how weather and seasons affect their migration. It uses clear visuals and maps to help us understand bird migration patterns better, which can be useful for scientists and nature lovers interested in protecting these birds.



### Page Highlights and Insights

###  Page 1: Bird Migration Overview
This page gives a big-picture view of bird migration. It explains the main reasons why birds migrate, like avoiding predators, finding food, or breeding. It shows interesting facts like how far and how fast birds usually fly and how many migrations succeed versus fail. There are also maps showing where migrations start and end, focusing on North America.

###  Page 2: Species and Regions
Here, the report breaks down migration by bird types—like hawks, cranes, and swallows—and looks at which regions they travel to. It compares how successful each species is in completing their migration and shows where they’re mostly found across the continents. It also looks at how far they travel and how fast they fly on average.

###  Page 3: Environmental Impact
This page explores how weather affects bird migration. It looks at how things like temperature, humidity, air pressure, and different weather conditions (rain, fog, wind) influence how far and fast birds fly and whether they succeed. For example, birds might fly differently in foggy or stormy weather, which affects their chances of success.
### Page 4: Migration Timing Patterns
This part shows when birds start and finish their migrations during the year. It highlights the months when most birds begin or end their trips and how this timing varies depending on the species and the reason for migrating. This helps us understand the seasonal rhythms of bird migration.

### Page 5: Regional Migration Insights
Finally, the report looks closely at different regions of the world and compares how many migrations happen there and how successful they are. It also looks at the flying altitude of different birds during migration. This helps identify important migration routes and regions where birds might need more protection.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide insights into bird migration using data analytics tools like Power BI. The analysis aims to uncover patterns and trends related to migration routes, timings, and species distribution.

## How to Use

1. Open the **Bird Migration-power bi project.pbix** in Power BI Desktop to explore the data visualizations and interact with the analytical report.
2. Open **bird_migration_data.csv** in a CSV reader or use Power BI to load the data and analyze it for further insights into bird migration.

## Requirements

- Power BI Desktop (for the .pbix file)
- CSV reader or Power BI (for the .csv file)
